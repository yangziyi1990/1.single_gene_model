We designed a model for single gene selection, named single-gene ensemble classifier(SGEC).

(1) Opening your matlab, and adding this fold path to your matlab enviroment.
(2) "Simulate_SGEC.m" is the code for single-gene ensemble classifier.Importing your data (such as GSE19188_train.mat) and running this program, the result will saved in the fold "Result".
(3) There are some compared method code for classification.("Simulated_*.m") SVM, Logistic+Lasso, Random Forest,K-NN
